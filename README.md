# Self-Modifying Card: Redux

Card creator For Null-Signal-era Netrunner, ported from [yonbergman/self-modifying-card](https://github.com/yonbergman/self-modifying-card) to SolidJS and TypeScript, and using [Mnemic's high-quality templates](https://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/comments/yuapf2/mnemics_custom_netrunner_cards_1024_custom_cards/).

Fully Operational&trade;, but WIP/YMMV.

### TODO

- Fix subroutine indendation
- Improve template and font integration
- Customizable render quality (currently 750x1050)
- Image handling on mobile
